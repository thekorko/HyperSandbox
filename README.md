# Welcome to HyperSandbox!

Hi fellow code reader, This is a repo where we play with different programming languages and try to create interesting and fun things with code!

The best Super repository -> Ideas alternativas

## First Project: **Untitled** Game:

**A game with a square** our first **pygame**, we should title it, it only moves and dies :(

### Game ideas:
Idea nº1: The box could possibly attack monsters, which are other bigger boxes, maybe shoot some bullets in a boss style fight, then repeat levels with various difficulties.

Idea nº2: The box could be placed inside a simple level with moderatelly sized enemies, and confront or evade them until a bigger enemy appears. Then repeats levels.

### Features:
**Support multiplayer up to two players using sockets**
**Melee and Ranged attacks**
**Simple effects for dying things**
